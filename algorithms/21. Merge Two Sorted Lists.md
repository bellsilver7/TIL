You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

Example 1:

```text
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
```

Example 2:
```text
Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []
```

Example 3:
```text
Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]
``` 

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100
- Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
